# dotnet.amsterdam User Group - Global Azure Day 2023
 
We are excited to turn into Azure Amsterdam for a day :-) and host Global Azure Day 2023 for the Amsterdam area.

Global Azure is from the community, for the community. During this global event, communities worldwide will organize local editions, like this one for the Amsterdam Area.

Planning for the day is still underway, and our schedule will be updated. We are considering hosting either a full-day event or an evening, depending on how many people we can find that want to share their Azure-related knowledge. If you are interested in sharing your knowledge with the community, please submit your session at our [user groups sessionize](https://sessionize.com/dotnet-amsterdam).

More details will follow via our [Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/dotnet-amsterdam/) and [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/company/dotnet-amsterdam).

If you have any questions, feedback, or thoughts, please contact the community [leadership team](https://www.meetup.com/dotnet-amsterdam/members/?op=leaders).
